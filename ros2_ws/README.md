## proposal_simulation_cell_v1_5_safety_virtual_force_interface

Status: `safety_virtual_force_interface_validated`

The v1.5 proposal simulation sprint adds a simulation-only runtime safety and virtual-force interface foundation. It adds the safety status interface on `/proposal_simulation_cell/safety_status`, contact-state classification on `/proposal_simulation_cell/contact_state`, virtual-force diagnostic command suggestions on `/proposal_simulation_cell/virtual_force_command`, and admittance diagnostic command suggestions on `/proposal_simulation_cell/admittance_command_suggestion`.

Evidence is stored in `ros2_ws/diagnostics/proposal_simulation_cell_v1_5/`. The validated run used Gazebo fallback because Isaac Sim was unavailable. The contact wrench topic and sample were available, the maximum observed force was `0.0981000000182301 N`, and the final contact state was `contact_below_threshold` against the configured `0.1 N` detection threshold.

Safety constraints are enforced in config and diagnostics: `command_output_enabled=false`, `motion_execution_enabled=false`, no MoveIt, no `/compute_ik`, no controllers, no real robot execution, no `FollowJointTrajectory`, and no command execution.
